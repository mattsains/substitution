Substitution
============

This is a small Sinatra (Ruby) application to handle teacher substitution at a high school.

It wasn't ever implemented, but I had fun making it.

Aside from using the Sinatra framework for web, this application also makes use of Data Mapper, The HAML templating language, and some shoddily written javascript.
